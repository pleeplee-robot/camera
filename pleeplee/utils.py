The LED class represents a colored landmark to be put in the garden.
These landmarks are mandatory for the robot to locate itself.
The parameters of the class are the following:
    - color : The color of the LED, it must be unique
    - point : The position of the LED in the plan
    - perimeter : True if the LED is on the perimeter.
                False otherwise. By default this value is true.

    - height : the difference of height between the robot's camera and the LED
