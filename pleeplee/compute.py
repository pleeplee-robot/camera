"""
This file contains the computation of all datas recieved by the robot to
find the robot position in the given perimeter.
The input datas are:
    - the map (user input the coordinate of LEDs landmarks)
    - the mode (user input, boolean true if it is a rectangle)
    - the side perpendicular to the robot direction at initialisation
    - the angle between the direction at initialisation and the north
    (magnetic captor, one data send at initialisation)
    - the angle between the actual direction and the north
    (magnetic captor, periodically)
    - the angle to at least two LEDs landmark (camera on step motor + programm
    to extract the angles, periodically)
    - the distance calculated from the blobs of light on the previous pictures
    - the datas linked to the odometry
    (previous position, estimated position, error margin)
"""
""" Initialisation procedure
During the initialisation phase the user has to put the LEDs landmark
on the map and input their coodinates and color into the API.
Before turning on the robot for initialisation phase it has to face a side
of the perimeter delimited by LEDs. The minimum number of LEDs landmark is 4.
The LEDs have to be of different colors for the location to work properly.

 The map has the following conventions:
  R(0, 0)                                   G(10, 0)

    angles are counter clockwise by convention however the rotation is clockwise
